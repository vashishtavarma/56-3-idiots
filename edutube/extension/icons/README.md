# Extension Icons

Add three PNG files here for the Chrome extension to load without warnings:

- **icon16.png** – 16×16 px  
- **icon48.png** – 48×48 px  
- **icon128.png** – 128×128 px  

You can export them from your app logo (e.g. from `edutube/frontend/public` or your design tool).  
Until these exist, Chrome may show a default puzzle icon for the extension.
